# tsv.sh - timestamping those videos from different capture devices

just pass the video file as argument which has the android format of file naming convention with the filename part before '_' as the starting timestamp.
note that this is designed for youtube shorts or facebook reels and essentially will handle only second increments and will fail if the higher derivatives has to change in the video. 
Update on June 24 2025 has enabled longer videos to be timestamped 
The image magick gravity positions the timestamp and this if you want to change try different values
* north is top center and east west south and combinations can be used
* the +0+8 option in annotate will create a margin inside the annotation in pixels the values are +(x)+(y)
