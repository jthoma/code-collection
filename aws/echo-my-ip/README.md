# Echo MY IP using aws sam

Running ```sam deploy -g``` from the folder will ask a series of questions and at the end the url will be shown. To use this one should have [AWS SAM](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/serverless-getting-started.html) an an [AWS Account](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/create-and-activate-aws-account/).
