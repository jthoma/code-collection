# A Simple Framework for AWS Lambda NodeJs 

This can be considered as a starting point of a framework with the basics only as of now. There is a session manager with sessions written into memcached. The included sam template is expected to deploy everything needed. This will cater to creating a rest api on serverless super fast. like the routes folder if written with get_path_to_service.js GET /path/to/service will invoke this and the sample template can be used to further incorporate functionality.
